WooCurrency lets you **easily** change currency for your customers based on their geolocation.

== Description ==

**WooCurrency** - Make your WooCommerce shop travel

**SELL IN ALL COUNTRIES**
>People like to buy on their country's currency. Wether the website is in their language or not, having their own currency help them determine the value of your products. WooCurrency has been designed for this purpose.

**EASY TO USE**
>**WooCurrency** is simple. You select the currencies you want to use on your website, the countries for which you want to sell on that currency and you're set!
>Rate changes are recovered every day through a web-service so that prices on different currencies are allways accurate.
>Your customers, based on their IP address (ipv4 or ipv6) will see the product on the currency of their country. If their country hasn't been selected in WooCurrency, the default WooCommerce currency will be used.
> * Configure your currency system in less than 5 minutes
> * No specific Add-Ons required
